++++ Day 1 - FreeCodeCamp 100days Code Challenge ++++

Started learning Go.

Tried solving 4 problems with Golang basics.

Questions solved,

1. Write a program which will find factors of given number and find whether the factor is even or odd.

2. Write a code which accepts a sequence of words as input and prints the words in a sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

3. Write a program, which will find all the numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma separated sequence on a single line.

4. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

Each solution is available in the corresponding question number.go file
