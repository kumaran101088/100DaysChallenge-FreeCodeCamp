++++ Day 10 - FreeCodeCamp 100days Code Challenge ++++

Late post but, keeping the 100days code challenge alive.

Tried solving 3 problems with Go.

Questions solved,

1. With   two   given   slices   {1,3,6,78,35,55}   and   {12,24,35,24,88,120,155},   write   a program to make a slice whose elements are intersection of the above given slices.

2. Write a program to print the slice after removing the value 24 in {12,24,35,24,88,120,155}.

3. With a given slice {12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155}, write a program to print this slice after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.

Each solution is available in the corresponding question number.go file
